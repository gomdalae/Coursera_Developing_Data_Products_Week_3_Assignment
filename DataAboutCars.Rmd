## Understanding Gas Mileage

Using the `mtcars` dataset I could attempt to understand the relationship
of various factors to gas mileage (`mpg`).

I plotted weight (`wt`) vs. mileage (`mpg`) spatially along the x/y axes. I visualized the number of cylinders (`cyl`) as colors in the plot.

## Visualizing the Data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", mode = 'markers', color = ~factor(cyl)) %>%
  layout(title = "Data About Cars")
```
